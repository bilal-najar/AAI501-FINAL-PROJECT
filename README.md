## Project Description
Define a problem on the dataset and describe it in terms of its real-world organizational or business application. The complexity level of the problem should be at least comparable to one of your assignments. The problem may use at least two different types of AI and machine learning algorithms that we have studied in this course, such as Classification, Clustering, and Regression, in an investigation of the analytics solution to the problem. This investigation must include some aspects of experimental comparison. Depending on the problem, you may choose to experiment with different types of algorithms, e.g., different types of classifiers and some experiments with tuning parameters of the algorithms. Alternatively, if your problem is suitable, you may use multiple algorithms (Clustering + Classification, etc.). Note that if there are a larger number of attributes in your selected dataset, you can try some type of feature selection to reduce the number of attributes. You may use summary statistics and visualization techniques to help you explain your findings in this project.
